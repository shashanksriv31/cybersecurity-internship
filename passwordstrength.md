#  Password Strength & Security

## What's this project about?

This project explores password security by testing various password strengths using online password-checking tools. It demonstrates how weak passwords are easily cracked, and
what makes strong passwords resilient to common attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.



## Tools I used

- **Kali Linux VM**
- **Firefox** (pre-installed in Kali)
- **Online tools**:
  - [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
  - [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
  - [NordPass Strength Checker](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)
- **xfce4-screenshooter**: For capturing screenshots inside the VM



## How I did it 

1. Launched Firefox inside Kali Linux VM.
2. Opened multiple password strength testing tools listed above.
3. Tested three passwords of increasing complexity:
   - Weak: `shashank123`
   - Medium: `Sh@shank2024`
   - Strong: `S#@hAnK!2024$%!!`
4. Took screenshots of the feedback from each tool.
5. Compared results and noted improvement tips.
6. Documented what makes a strong password and how attackers try to break them.

### Strong Password Test (`S#@hAnK!2024$%!!`)

## What I learned

- Longer passwords (12+ characters) significantly increase security.
- Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols creates stronger passwords.
- Even if a password “looks” secure, short ones are still vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Password reuse across platforms is dangerous and must be avoided.
- Password managers help generate and store unique, strong passwords securely.

## Key Insights 

###  What makes a strong password?
- At least 12–16 characters
- Contains letters (both cases), numbers, symbols
- Avoids dictionary words and patterns
- Not reused across multiple platforms

###  What makes a weak password?
- Too short (less than 8 characters)
- Common names or dictionary words
- Birthdays or usernames
- Repeated patterns like `abcd1234`

###  Common Attacks
- **Brute-force**: Tries all possible combinations
- **Dictionary attack**: Tries known/common passwords
- **Credential stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials from other sites
