# Network Reconnaissance Assignment

## What's this project about? 

This project is all about learning how to scan a local network for open ports and identifying potential security risks. 

## Tools I used 

- Nmap:  scanning networks and finding open ports.
- Wireshark (optional): A tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. 

## How I did it üìù

1. I installed Nmap and learned how to use it to scan my local network.
2. I ran the scan and got a list of IP addresses and open ports.
3. Installed the wireshark and used that for analyzed using wireshark.
4. I analyzed the results and looked for potential security risks.
   

## Code snippets 

Installed nmap in linux.
sudo apt install nmap 

Installed wireshark in linux.
sudo apt install wireshark

the command used to run nmap in linux.
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

And here's how to save the results to a file:
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt

## What I learned 

- How to use Nmap to scan a local network for open ports.
- How to analyze the results and identify potential security risks.
- how to use the wireshark and how to see the packet anaysis in the wireshark
- How to save the results to a file for future reference.
  

## Conclusion 

From this project I learnt to do the port scan and how to detect the network ports and tcp and udp in the wireshark to see the working of the networks
