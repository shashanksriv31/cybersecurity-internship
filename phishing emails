Phishing Email and Header Analysis

Task 2 Overview
This project is part of a cybersecurity to analyze a phishing email and examine its headers to identify signs of phishing and email spoofing.

Phishing Indicators
Suspicious Sender Address:
The email is pretending to be from LIDL but the sender domain is innovativetech2.net.pl, which is not a legitimate LIDL domain.

Urgent Language:
The message says ‚ÄúHurry up. The number of prizes is limited! Confirm now!‚Äù to pressure the user to act quickly.

Too Good to Be True Offer:
Claims that the user has won a Makita Tool Kit without participating in any contest.

Mismatched Branding:
Poor formatting and color schemes that do not match the professional look of LIDL‚Äôs actual emails.

Suspicious Links:
The ‚ÄúConfirm Now‚Äù button is likely to lead to a phishing website. (Actual link not visible but commonly a phishing trap.)
