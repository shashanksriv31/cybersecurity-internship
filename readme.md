Phishing Indicators
Suspicious Sender Address:
The email is pretending to be from LIDL but the sender domain is innovativetech2.net.pl, which is not a legitimate LIDL domain.

Urgent Language:
The message says ‚ÄúHurry up. The number of prizes is limited! Confirm now!‚Äù to pressure the user to act quickly.

Too Good to Be True Offer:
Claims that the user has won a Makita Tool Kit without participating in any contest.

Mismatched Branding:
Poor formatting and color schemes that do not match the professional look of LIDL‚Äôs actual emails.

Suspicious Links:
The ‚ÄúConfirm Now‚Äù button is likely to lead to a phishing website. (Actual link not visible but commonly a phishing trap.)

Key Findings
The email passed SPF and DKIM, but these can be configured on unauthorized domains.

The sending IP is linked to suspicious activity.

The offer and sender information indicate a phishing attempt.

The email uses social engineering tactics to make the recipient act quickly.


Conclusion
This phishing email uses social engineering, fake rewards, and domain spoofing to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link. Despite passing some authentication checks, header analysis reveals the true source and confirms phishing intent.
